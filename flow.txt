Here is a general outline of how you can implement the Quine-McCluskey algorithm in C++:

1. Create a data structure to represent the truth table: To start, you'll need to create a data structure to represent the truth table for the Boolean function you want to minimize. A two-dimensional array or a vector of vectors can be used to represent the truth table, where each row represents a term and each column represents an input.

2. Implement the term grouping step: The first step of the Quine-McCluskey algorithm is to group the terms in the truth table based on the number of "1"s they contain. You can implement this step by creating a vector of vectors, where each inner vector represents a group of terms with the same number of "1"s.

3. Implement the comparison step: The next step is to compare each pair of terms in the same group and combine terms that differ by only one bit. You can implement this step by iterating through the terms in each group and comparing each pair of terms bit by bit. If two terms differ by only one bit, you can combine them into a single term.

4. Repeat the comparison step: Repeat the comparison step until no more terms can be combined. The resulting terms are the prime implicants.

5. Implement the prime implicant selection step: To implement the prime implicant selection step, you'll need to create a chart where each row represents a prime implicant and each column represents a term in the truth table. You can then use this chart to determine which prime implicants are necessary to cover all the terms in the truth table.

6. Express the result: The result can be expressed as a sum of products using the selected prime implicants.

7. Simplify the result: If desired, you can simplify the result using Boolean algebra laws.


These are the functions we will need to implement.
